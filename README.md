# Radar #
####Upgrade Your Social Calendar.####

Radar is a mobile-first location-based social app where users can discover events in their area, let others know about events they're hosting, and join events they want to attend. The map page shows all the events in a given area[, and allows users to swipe through different dates and times to view events in a given time frame]. [If users join an event, hosts will receive notification of the new attendee.]

Radar is coded in Javascript using AngularJS and the PhoneGap frameworks. App views are created using AngularJS to allow for dynamic dom manipulation and a structured MVC environment. The PhoneGap open source framework is used to gain access to native mobile phone functionality core to the app including the camera, image library, GPS, and inappbrowser. 

Hammer.js is used for multi-touch and swiping functionality, while Topcoat and Stylus are used for CSS and preprocessing. The Grunt task runner is used to automate updating of CSS files.
